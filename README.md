## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The goal of the course project is to create a script (`run_analysis.R`) for performing the analysis and producing a tidy data set (`TidyDataSet.txt`).
More information about the data and the analysis can be found in the [Code Book](CodeBook.md).

## Prerequisites
1. The project data (folder and file structure) unpacked as a sub-folder in your working directory.
2. The following R-packages installed: `data.table` and `dplyr`.
3. Script file `run_analysis.R` resides in your working directory.

## Executing the script
Run `source("run_analysis.R")`.

## Output
The script produces a tidy data set in a form of file `TidyDataSet.txt` in your working directory.
